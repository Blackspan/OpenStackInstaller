OpenStackInstaller
==================

Experimental branch concentrating on improving the OSinstall.sh originally built as a quick set up script for Diablo and Essex (although the vast majority of effort has been in Essex).

This release simplifies and improves the scripts to make the process easier to troubleshoot and more friendly to the end user:

The installer will be split into two sections:

* Configuration of environment
* Installation into that environment

This will pave the way for small, multi-node environment from a single install.

There are lots of ways to install OpenStack - this may incorporate many of those features in an effort to simplify how its done.

Would love to hear from people who are wanting to contribute to this. Fork it, change it, let me know what improvements you want to be made to it!
